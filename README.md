# Automatic-Speech-Recognition
This project involves building and fine-tuning a speech-to-text (STT) model using the wav2vec 2.0 framework for Arabic language recognition.
Two distinct datasets are used, each processed independently:
1. Standard Arabic Dataset: Mozilla Common Voice Arabic corpus was used
2. Egyptian Arabic Dataset: Collected by scraping audio data from sources such as YouTube, podcasts, and Egyptian TV programs.
